# Voice-Powered AI Assistant

This project demonstrates a **voice-powered AI assistant** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The assistant leverages browser APIs for **speech recognition** and **text-to-speech** functionality, and integrates with the **Groq Llama AI API** to generate smart responses. The goal was to create an interactive voice experience entirely in the browser, with no backend required.
